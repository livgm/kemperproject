      <h2 id = "Family">Family Background </h2> John Kemper came from eleven straight Army generations, going back all the way to the Indian wars. (5, p. 1) With few exceptions, most of John Kemper’s male ancestors were army men. His earliest known ancestor was Major John Mason (1600-1672), on his mother’s side. Born in England, Mason fought in the Pequot War in Connecticut in 1637. Kemper’s family seems to somehow have skipped fighting in the American Revolution. Many family members distinguished themselves during the Civil War. Two of his great-grandfathers on his mother’s side were general officers in the Union Army, both West Point graduates. Kemper’s paternal grandfather Andrew Kemper, who grew up in Cincinnati, served on the Union side as a Captain in the Federal Army, while all the other Kemper fought on the Confederate side. (5, p. 6)
      <br>John Kemper’s father, Colonel James Brown Kemper, was born in 1876 and raised in Cincinnati, where his father was a practicing physician. James Brown Kemper was commissioned from civil life as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry in 1898 while still in college. Later, he served the Army in conflicts in the Philippines in the early 1900’s, in the Cuban pacification campaign in 1905, in a number of posts in the United States. After another tour in the Philippines in the 1920’s, he was eventually assigned a position as a recruiting officer in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he and his family remained until his retirement. (5, p. 6; Andover Bulletin, Vol. 65, No. 4, February 1972). Additionally, James Kemper was very active in civic organizations like the Rotary Club. James Kemper was very effective at connecting with civilians, and consequently very popular all around New England. He truly was a role model to his children, a charismatic man with integrity and a keen interest in bringing out the best in his children.<br>
      John’s mom, Mercer (Mason) Kemper, was born in 1880 in a family with a strong military tradition and she attended Abbot Academy. John described said that his father “was very sentimental and my mother could be extraordinarily shrewd. She was more quick-witted than he. She was the kind of gal who could pull off the tricky situations at an important diplomatic dinner party which she would be putting [on] … she was patriotic…  She was an old soldier.” (5, p. 44)
      <h2 id = "Connection">Connection to Andover</h2>John Kemper didn’t join the prep school world as an “Old Boy.” His great-grandfather, General Ord, had taken in a widowed nephew, who went to Andover and then to Yale. This nephew was the only member of the family who ever made money. Most of John’s family was soldiers, with a few doctors in between. (5, p. 4)
      When the nephew, who had attended Andover, realized that his cousin, John’s grandmother, was very poor with no ability to educate her three children, he took it upon himself in appreciation of what his uncle had done for him, to educate her three daughters. He sent them to the only girls’ school he knew, Abbot Academy (5, p. 5) Moreover, the girls on John’s wife’s side were Thompsons; their parents lived in Andover. John’s family often came to visit the Thompsons in Andover when they were in the area. (5, p. 60)
      <h2 id = "Education">Education </h2> John Mason Kemper was born on September 1, 1912 in Fort D.A. Russel, Wyoming, to Colonel of Infantry James Brown and Mercer (Mason) Kemper. (5, p. 17) He had an older and a younger sister. Following his father around the world, he had the opportunity to attend eight public schools, among them four high schools in different parts of the country and even in the Philippine Islands. He then returned to the United States, where he continued high school at the Columbian     Preparatory School in Washington, D.C. In 1935 (5, p. 3), Kemper graduated from the United States Military Academy (USMA) – 132nd in a class of 275 – (Time Magazine 1962, p. 80) with the degree of Bachelor of Science. To get admitted to West Point, Kemper for the first time studied hard and came out sixth in a field of about 100 candidates for presidential appointment. At West Point Kemper distinguished himself as a leader academically and in extra-curricular activities – manager of the   varsity lacrosse team, superintendent of the Sunday school, captain of his regiment and class president. (Time Magazine 1962, p. 19-80). Kemper’s teaching career started when he taught Sunday classes to young boys during his studies at West Point. (5, p. 99).
      <br>From 1939 onward Kemper taught as an Instructor in History at the USMA and, at the age of twenty-eight, went back to his studies, this time in Far Eastern History at Harvard University Summer School. Three years later, in 1942, Columbia University conferred him a Master of Arts in History. As a historian and a Lieutenant Colonel, he organized and led a group of historians to write the combat history of the U.S. Army in World War II. His skillful leadership of such a complex and important project produced twelve comprehensive monographs produced by a 500-man team. (Time Magazine 1962, p. 80)
      Aided by his combination of military aptitude and scholarship, Kemper’s military career continued to flourish. He was next appointed as Cadet Captain and Regimental Adjutant in the U.S. Corps of Cadets, Second Lieutenant of Infantry, Assistant Executive Officer in the Military Intelligence, Assistant Chief of Operations Staff in the Analysis and Methods Office of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in Caserta, Italy, in 1945. In the same year, he was assigned as the Chief of Planning Section in the Historical Division of the U.S. Army.
      <h2 id="Wife">Silvia Pratt Kemper</h2> Although John Kemper was determined to prioritize building his career before taking on “domestic responsibilities”, his plan didn’t quite work out as intended. John Kemper’s first date with Sylvia Pratt was in New York, where she was hosted by a friend of Kemper’s father (5, p. 91). He had known her for several years and her mother had gone to Abbot with his mother, so the families knew each other Kemper remembers that he and Sylvia Pratt had lunch on top of the Empire State Building on their first date (5, p. 92). It was who wanted to get married right away (5, p. 47). When the Kemper family arrived on the Andover campus in 1948, Sylvia proved to be the ideal headmaster’s wife. As the mother of three girls, she made every effort to get to know the Andover boys, cheering them on at games and competitions. She also invited three boys to live at Phelps house and had many more over for meals and snacks.
      <h2 id ="Becoming">Becoming Headmaster</h2> When the Trustees learned of Claude Fuess’s intention to resign in 1948, a massive search for Andover’s eleventh headmaster was launched immediately. It was an open search, one that invited the whole community as well as friends of the School to send in their thoughts and suggestions. A significant number of people demanded “a man with a completely fresh approach – not necessarily a graduate of the school, [nor] a graduate of an Ivy League college, but one who could look at the school without any preconceptions and judge its procedures and practices without being the prisoner of tradition.” (Allis, p. 530) Phillips Academy needed a headmaster with an innovative perspective and with the organizational skills and vision to bring the school forward into the changing conditions of the post-war period and chart its course for many years into the future.
      Among others, John Kemper was known to two of the Trustees of Phillips Academy, Colonel Henry L. Stimson and Doctor James Baxter III, then president of Williams College. On December 4, 1947 he was asked to assume the headmastership effective on the 1st of the following July. To do so meant resigning from the Army and giving up the possibility of completing enough service to retire. Kemper was 35 when he became PA’s headmaster. Initially, Kemper was amused and hesitant when urged to lead Andover. He didn’t know much about private schools for boys. All he knew about Andover was that girls at nearby Abbot Academy, where his wife and his mother had gone. As soon as he entered the school, John Kemper started working with passion and enthusiasm and lived up to his promise of being a team player. He said: “I don’t consider myself a great man, but I have been able to do one thing. I can build a team… a team with a common purpose, and Andover would be great – not because of me, but as a result of the efforts of all those on the team.” (Allis, 531)
      <h2 id = "Impact">Impact on Faculty and Staff</h2> Kemper came to Andover convinced that his primary task was to build a strong and effective faculty.
“A school can be only as good as its teachers,” he wrote. (Allis, p. 340-341)
His policy towards the faculty included:
<ol>
<li> involving a broader audience, including trustees and staff, rather than relying on the advice of a few members of faculty and administration</li>
<li> raising salaries for both staff and faculty (at an early meeting with the Trustee, he stated that he could not head an institution where many of the nonacademic employees were so “shockingly” underpaid, and he won approval for the raises for nonacademic staff. (Allis, 537)</li>
<li> establishing fixed starting salaries and minimum increments for future years for faculty</li>
<li> starting a college grant program of six hundred dollars a year for Faculty children, which faculty families still benefit from today. (Allis, p. 542)</li>
<li> starting a housing policy that awarded houses on the basis of seniority, further determined by a faculty housing committee that carefully reviewed each applicant’s situation to make this complex process more equitable. (Allis, 544)</li>
<li> initiating the Faculty Leave of Absence Program in 1954 to provide opportunities for travel, study, research, or new experience for teachers. Teachers on sabbatical received full pay plus a $1,500 stipend for travel. (Allis, 542)</li>
<li> launch of the “Andover Teaching Fellowship” program in 1956: it contributed to an exchange of new ideas among the faculty, granted more space in the community for faculty’s families and enabled college graduates to spend a year at Andover practicing teaching, followed by a year of graduate school paid for by the Academy.</li>
</ol>
<br>Kemper followed four basic rules: 1. play no favorites; 2. consult the man concerned before making a decision affecting him or his work; 3. recognize merit and good work in any and all ways possible; and 4. build up the dignity of the profession of teaching. (Allis, p. 541)
<h2 id = "Principles">Guiding Principles</h2> Kemper can be considered the great reformer of Phillips Academy: the one that gave the school the physical structure and organization it currently has and values that it has never stopped upholding ever since.
He confirmed the 1947 faculty resolution stating that “the existence of fraternities is not in the best interest of Phillips Academy.”. (Andover Bulletin, February 1972). By 1951, Kemper had dismantled the elitist fraternities to make the school environment more inclusive.
Kemper was worried about the “lucky-me” attitude and grade-getter behavior he had observed in many Andover boys, whose main focus seemed to be getting into elite colleges. As no surprise, this narrow view of solely aiming for good grades to get into a prestigious college angered some faculty.
The one thing that was always on Kemper’s mind was whether the academy was using its resources and wealth prudently, and whether schools and communities beyond the Andover bubble would benefit from them. “We should be identified with public schools,” he said. “Our job is to be available to anyone who wants to use us. We must be of service.” (Time Magazine, Oct. 26, 1962, 77) Kemper also firmly believed that both the school and family were charged with the responsibility of educating the youth. Unlike today, when Andover students can rely on various support systems for academic and health matters, Andover took more of a “sink or swim” approach in Kemper’s day. There was little room for close relationships between the boys and their teachers and house counselors. In fact, Andover could be a very cold place.
<h2 id = "Talent">Talent Search at Andover</h2> Kemper was a fundraiser and an advocate for national programs that recruited talented youth from underprivileged backgrounds. A general concern in the 1960s about the lack of access and diversity in independent schools evoked programs like the Independent Schools Talent Search Program (ISTSP) and A Better Chance (ABC), which opened the doors of independent schools and summer programs, to youngsters from poor families but with “rich minds.” These underprivileged children were mainly from African- American, American Indian and Puerto Rican families. The recruits were expected to make a difference in their communities once out of college. In places like Harlem, rural Georgia or on an isolated Indian reservation, these awards symbolized for the whole community possibilities for change which never had been considered before.
Kemper was a Trustee for ISTSP and later ABC. Besides resources from the Federal Government’s Office of Economic Opportunity and scholarships from the schools themselves, much of the funding had to come from private philanthropy. As a headmaster of Phillips Academy and as a public figure, Kemper sought the economic support of big corporations as well as private businesses and foundations, writing personally to their spokespersons.
By 1966, after a few years of operation, 105 independent schools had endorsed the programs, Andover and Exeter included. While ISTSP was essentially a boarding school program with a limited number of spots, ABC covered that gap by opening also to selected public secondary (day) schools and thus provided the opportunity for private-public school cooperation. By 1968, there were 30 students at Andover who had arrived through these talent identification programs (Adriance, 1968)
<h2 id = "Public">A National Public School</h2> Throughout his administration Kemper always considered Phillips Academy to have an obligation to the community at large. His goal was to make Phillips Academy “the national public school.” (Phillips Bulletin, November 1955, p. 2) This vision had a clear prerequisite, namely that the school was open to qualifying youth from every geographical quarter as well as every social, economic and racial background. Headmaster Kemper wrote that there were two main reasons why access and diversity were so important at Andover:<br>
<i>“First, so that any boy in this school can know other boys from different backgrounds, thereby enhancing his understanding of different points of view and different ways of looking at things…My second purpose would be to have the school remain in the mainstream of American education, sensitive to the widest possible variety of needs, aware of changes in educational goals and methods, alert to varying mores of young people.”(Brown, 1965, p. 2). (p. 130) </i>
The fullest expression of Andover’s intent in seeking “youth from every quarter” came in 1957, when Andover adopted a need-blind policy for the first time. Andover’s need-blind policy stipulated that “Any deserving boy who can meet the Academy's requirements is assured of full consideration in the competition for admission, no matter what his economic, social, or racial background.”
Andover was among the first institutions at the secondary and postsecondary level to declare a need-blind policy. Over the course of the next five years all of the Ivy League institutions, along with such colleges as Amherst, Williams, Wesleyan, Stanford, Pomona, Reed, Carleton, Swarthmore, Duke, and the University of Chicago, adopted the policy.
Andover had once again lofted itself into collegiate company by aligning its policies, practices, and values with elite higher education. Prior to this decision, separate admissions committees had existed for scholarship and non-scholarship boys, but Andover’s Admissions Committee and Scholarship Committee were merged in the late 1950s. (Carney, p. 119)
<h2 id = "AP">Advanced Placement Program</h2> In the early 1950s, a great discussion was underway to study the overlap of educational matters between high school and college.  By then, Andover’s courses were already so scholastic that some of the material being taught at Andover was repeated when Andover students entered college. In the spring of 1951, Kemper urged Exeter and Lawrenceville to join a collaborative study with Harvard, Yale and Princeton. This study resulted in the publication of “General Education in School and College and led to setting up a nationwide Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board which is still used today to place high school students into college. Out of the 115 new students admitted to Harvard as sophomores in 1962, 20 were Andover graduates. According to College Board President Frank H. Bowles, the average Andover graduate “could enter the junior year in a great many colleges without risk of failure.” (Time Magazine, Oct. 26, 1962, p. 77) Set on 436 acres of land with 139 buildings, led by an all-male faculty of 85, Phillips Academy already resembled a college campus. While the tuition of $1,800 was comparatively low compared to other top prep schools, 28% of the student body was on partial or full scholarship, depending on the student’s family income. As today, all Andover students were on scholarship, since even in the early 1960s Andover spent $3,400 on each student. (Time Magazine, Oct. 26, 1962, p. 77).
<h2 id = "Raise">'Andover Program' Fund Raise </h2>Kemper led the “Andover Program,” which began in 1959: a record-breaking three-year, seven-million-dollar fund drive for new construction all around campus. Many of the buildings and facilities continue to define the Andover campus today, such as the Memorial Gym, the Sumner Smith Hockey Rink, the Rabbit Pond dormitories, the rowing boathouse, the extension of both the OWHL (Oliver Wendell Holmes library) and the Memorial Cage, the Arts and Communication Center, the Sylvia Pratt Kemper Chapel, George Washington Hall stage, the Drama Lab, the Wheelock Whitney Tennis Courts, the David Milton Underwood Room and many other facilities, including four new dormitories. The program concluded in the early sixties.
<h2 id = "Committee">Faculty Steering Committee</h2> In 1965, Kemper piloted a Faculty Steering Committee on the future of Andover to study the changes taking place in the American society, the role of Phillips Academy among educational institutions and the changes it should make to better fulfill its mission. According to the first report in 1966, greater diversity was needed in order to better reflect the nation, as well as to provide “a stimulating intellectual atmosphere, a more catholic social experience and a broader role for PA in American society” (Phillips Academy, 1965; Carney, p. 135).
The committee also established the cluster system and dissolved class rankings and established the 0-6 grading scale—a system unique to Andover, and still in place today. (Phillips Academy. (1965). Steering Committee report. Files of the 1965 Steering Committee, Phillips Academy Archives, Andover, Massachusetts, Carney, p. 136)
<h2 id = "Outward">Outward Bound</h2> Kemper was always on the lookout for new extracurricular programs that would positively influence his students’ well-being and character. A program known as Outward Bound *(Outward Bound USA records, 1954-2001, Josh Miner Outward Bound USA collection,  http://www.noblenet.org/paarchives/?page_id=2325 ) proved especially influential. Its development in the United States was to a great extent an Andover affair that began in 1950 when Trustee John P. Stevens heard about a German educator named Kurt Hahn. Working in England, Hahn had developed innovative techniques for dealing with adolescents. Focusing not on academic aptitude, but rather a young man’s character and physique, Hahn’s main goal was to develop “good people” through what he called “experience therapy” and “Samaritan services.” (Allis, 555)
Following Hahn’s principles, Andover students were exposed to the Academy’s own Outward Bound program which included overnight trips to the White Mountains, thrilling descents of the Memorial Tower, and a mandatory ropes course for new students. These activities led to the development of the Search and Rescue team, introduced at Phillips Academy in 1964.
<h2 id ="Off-campus">Off-campus Program</h2>A collaborative cultural program, introduced in 1964, was Schoolboys Abroad, later renamed as School Year Abroad after Andover began admitting girls. Offered to eleventh graders as an opportunity to study abroad for a year and live with host families, the program allowed them to fully immerse themselves in a foreign language and its culture. Spain was the initial locale picked for the program. In 1967, it expanded to include Rennes, France. (Allis, 562)
Another off-campus program that Phillips Academy joined was the Washington Intern Program, which had been set up by Exeter four years earlier. An upper student would spend spring term working full-time in the office of a Senator or Representative. (Allis, 562)
<h2 id = "Death">Final years </h2> Sylvia tragically passed away while the couple was on a visit to England in 1961. On December 17, 1963, John Kemper married Abby Castle, who had graduated at abbot Academy. (Allis, 592) In 1971, a few months before Kemper’s death, Phillips Academy decided to become a coeducational school. After striving for most of the year to overcome the effects of a malignant tumor removed from his lung in January 1971, Kemper seemed very well when school re-opened in September, but then rapidly lost strength and decided to retire in October.
On October 13, in an All School Meeting, Kemper announced his retirement to the students and he passed away on December 4, 1971, in the Isham Infirmary.
